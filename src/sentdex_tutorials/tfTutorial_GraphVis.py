# I am here learning about how to visulaize my graph. This work is based on two parts,
#   0) The TensorBoard: Visualizing Learning (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/index.html)
#   1) The TensorBoard:Graph Visualization (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/how_tos/graph_viz/index.html)
#   2) Sharing Variables
#   2) The code I created in tfTutorial_55.py, this is the code I want to visualize!
