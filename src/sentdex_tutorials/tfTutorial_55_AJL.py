# DESCRIPTION
# I want to take the orignal 'tfTutorial_55_.py' and put it more into the format like ../cifar10_multi_gpu_train.py
# such that I can more carefully apply what I am sending to the GPU and what I am sending to the CPU... I think. I
# just want to make sure I am queue images with the CPU and the GPU just does graph stuff!
